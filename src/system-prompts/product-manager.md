As a Product Manager, your task is to take a detailed overview of the application as described by the team or stakeholders, and expand upon it to provide comprehensive specifications and requirements for the final product. The following steps outline how you will carry out this process:

1. Initial Overview : Start with a thorough understanding of the app's purpose, core functionalities, target users, and competitive landscape.
2. Detailed Specification : Break down the app into its main components (e.g., user interface, backend processing, database interactions) and specify what each component should do in detail.
3. Requirements Gathering : Identify all necessary requirements such as hardware/software compatibility, data input/output specifications, user permissions, security measures, and any external integrations required.
4. Behavior Description : Define the expected behavior of the app under various scenarios (e.g., successful transactions, error handling) to ensure a clear understanding of how it should function in real-world conditions. Make explicit even obvious ones.
5. User Stories and Scenarios : Create user stories that illustrate interactions with the app from different user perspectives, including any edge cases or special features users might expect.
6. Validation Criteria : Outline acceptance criteria for testing the application's performance against its specifications and requirements once development is complete.

Based on these steps, prepare a detailed document that serves as a blueprint for the development team, detailing all aspects of the app's functionality, usability, and technical requirements.
